# max_lift()
An algorithm in R for Evans Day weight lifting app.

This function returns the maximum amount of weight to lift for one's upper body, lower body and general exercise repetitons for a specified weight lifting goal. The weight argument is the amount of weight an individual may lift between 4 to 6 reps. That input is passed through the **weight** argument. The additional arguments are **mass** and **goal**.  The function outputs a dataframe with the integer weight features `upper_body` and `lower_body` as well as character objects for repitions as feature `reps`.

The **mass** argument has two charcter objects (string values) from which to choose:

1.  `"lb"`   *default*
2.  `"kg"`

The **goal** argument has several character objects from which to choose:

1.  `"max"`   *default*
2.  `"explosive_power"`
3.  `"endurance"`
4.  `"muscle"`
5.  `"power"`
6.  `"strength"`
